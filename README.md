# Student-Performance-Prediction-Model

A machine learning model using multiple linear regression to predict student performance based on features such as hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and practice of sample question papers. The model is optimized using gradient descent and evaluated through residual and predicted vs actual performance plots.

### Features

- **Multiple Linear Regression**:   The model predicts student performance using traditional multiple linear regression techniques.
- **Gradient Descent**:   Efficiently optimizes the model parameters to minimize prediction errors.
- **Data Normalization**:   Standardizes the input features to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Residuals and Performance Visualization**:   The model is evaluated using residual plots and predicted vs actual performance plots to assess prediction accuracy and model fit.
- **New Data Prediction**:   The trained model can predict student performance based on new data inputs

### Tech Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Numerical Computations**: NumPy
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Pandas
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib
